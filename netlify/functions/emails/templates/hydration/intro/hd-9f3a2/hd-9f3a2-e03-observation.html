              <p>Hello again.</p>

              <p>
                As you continue, we want to offer a little guidance on what actually matters right now.
              </p>

              <p>
                At this stage, the most important thing you can do is observe.
              </p>

              <p>
                Not analyze.<br>
                Not judge.<br>
                Just notice.
              </p>

              <p>
                Hydration may affect how you feel during the day,<br>
                how you sleep,<br>
                how your digestion responds,<br>
                or how emotionally steady you feel.
              </p>

              <p>
                It may also feel completely neutral.
              </p>

              <p>
                That doesn’t mean it isn’t working.
              </p>

              <p>
                Often, the first sign of progress is a reduction in chaos — not a dramatic improvement.
              </p>

              <p>
                Try not to watch your body too closely.<br>
                Let patterns emerge over time.
              </p>

              <p>
                You don’t need to track anything.<br>
                You don’t need to report anything.<br>
                This information is for you.
              </p>

              <p>
                For now
