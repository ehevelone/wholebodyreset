Welcome.

You’ve entered Guided Foundations — a slow, body-led program designed to restore stability before anything aggressive is attempted.

There is nothing you need to “do” today.

This program works best when you read first, observe second, and act only when your body agrees.

We always begin with hydration — not because it’s trendy, but because every system depends on it:
minerals, lymph, liver, nervous system, and detox capacity.

Before you start anything, take a moment to orient yourself.

📍 Start here:

📘 Please download and read the included *Whole Body Reset – Foundations Edition* guide.
It provides the context that makes everything else make sense.

Take your time with the book. When you’re ready, begin the program here:

https://https://wholebodyreset.life/gf/https://wholebodyreset.life/gf/or-9a4e2.html

That page explains how this program works, how to move through it, and how to know when to pause.

Move at your own pace.
There are no deadlines.
No catching up.
No falling behind.

You’ll receive gentle reminders every few days — thank you for taking this journey with us.
