    "body_communication": [
      "What you’re describing is something many people notice when their system has been under sustained load.",
      "This does not suggest failure, missed steps, or that anything has gone wrong.",
      "It sounds like your body is communicating rather than breaking down."
    ],

    "regulation_over_escalation": [
      "Your body appears to be asking for regulation rather than escalation.",
      "This often happens when systems need integration, not more input.",
      "Nothing here suggests that pushing harder would be supportive."
    ],

    "holding_steady": [
      "Stability itself is meaningful progress.",
      "There is no advantage to moving forward quickly here.",
      "Holding steady allows systems to settle, organize, and regain capacity."
    ],

    "slow_down_reassurance": [
      "Slowing the pace is not a setback.",
      "Reducing intensity can protect progress rather than delay it.",
      "Backing off slightly is often the most supportive response."
    ],

    "no_action_required": [
      "Nothing needs to change right now.",
      "Nothing needs to be added.",
      "Consistency may be the most supportive choice at this stage."
    ],

    "readiness_acknowledgement": [
      "Your body appears to be tolerating current support more steadily.",
      "Some people find this is when curiosity about the next layer naturally arises.",
      "Readiness can be acknowledged without needing immediate action."
    ],

    "optional_next_context": [
      "If you choose to explore further, doing so slowly is usually best.",
      "There is no requirement to move forward before you feel ready.",
      "Stability remains the priority, even when readiness is present."
    ],

    "pause_and_support": [
      "This may be a signal that your nervous system needs more support right now.",
      "Reducing stimulation often helps restore balance.",
      "Safety and regulation come before momentum."
    ],

    "external_support_context": [
      "Some situations benefit from individualized guidance.",
      "Working alongside a qualified practitioner can provide added safety.",
      "This does not mean foundational work has failed."
    ],

    "closing_grounding": [
      "Understanding your body builds confidence over time.",
      "Nothing here requires urgency.",
      "You are allowed to move at your body’s pace."
