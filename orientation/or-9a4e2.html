  <h1>Welcome to Guided Foundations</h1>

  <p class="orientation">
    This program is designed to walk with you — not push you —
    through the foundations of healing.
    There is no required pace, no forced protocol, and no expectation
    to “do it all.”
  </p>

  <p>
    By now, we hope you have read
    <em>Whole Body Reset: Foundations Edition</em>,
    which was included in your package.
    That book explains <strong>why this program exists</strong>
    and how frustrated we were during our own healing journey.
  </p>

  <p>
    Like many people, we were told conflicting information,
    rushed into protocols, and expected to “power through”
    reactions that didn’t feel right.
    We kept hearing that the answers were “out there” —
    and while that was true, finding them required digging,
    trial and error, and learning the hard way.
  </p>

  <p>
    Guided Foundations was created to bring all of that scattered
    information into one grounded, organized place —
    so you don’t have to piece it together alone.
    This program is meant to support you
    <strong>alongside us</strong>,
    not ahead of you and not behind you.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most important lessons we learned is this:
    <strong>your body will always tell you what it needs next</strong>.
    The challenge is learning how to listen without fear or pressure.
    This program is designed to help you recognize those signals,
    understand what they mean,
    and move forward in a way that feels safe and sustainable.
  </p>

  <p>
    There is no finish line here.
    There is only the next supportive step —
    taken at your pace.
