              <p>Hello,</p>

              <p>
                If metals support has made you feel more sensitive,
                overwhelmed, or reactive, we want to say this clearly:
              </p>

              <p>
                Nothing has gone wrong.
              </p>

              <p>
                When the body is already under strain, even gentle support
                can feel like too much — not because it’s harmful,
                but because capacity is limited.
              </p>

              <p>
                In these moments, the goal is not to continue forward.
                The goal is to protect stability.
              </p>

              <p>
                That often means slowing down, reducing input,
                and allowing the nervous system to settle
                before anything else is considered.
              </p>

              <p>
                You do not need to push through this phase.
                Pausing is not failure — it’s information.
              </p>

              <p>
                We’ll guide you gently from here.
              </p>
