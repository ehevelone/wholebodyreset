As your system stabilizes, hydration can begin to do more supportive work.

This is not about pushing harder.
It’s about noticing whether your body has the capacity for a little more structure.

Hydration supports:
• mineral balance
• lymph movement
• nervous system regulation
• detox readiness

But only when the foundation is steady.

If hydration has felt supportive so far — not draining, not agitating — you may be ready to explore the next level.

There is no requirement to move forward.
Staying where you are is always acceptable.

The goal is not progress for progress’ sake —
the goal is stability that lasts.
