Hi,

Here’s something most people aren’t warned about:

When the body starts to calm down, it can feel uncomfortable.

For systems that have lived in stress, urgency, or survival mode, quiet can feel unfamiliar — even unsettling. Some people describe this as boredom, restlessness, or a vague sense that something should be happening.

That doesn’t mean something is wrong.

It often means your nervous system is adjusting to a lower baseline for the first time in a long while.

You don’t need to fill the space.
You don’t need to add stimulation.
You don’t need to chase a feeling.

Just let calm be unfamiliar without judging it.

Check in gently:

Right now, do you feel:

• More settled, even if it feels odd
• About the same
• More uncomfortable or restless

There’s no right response here — just awareness.

Warmly,
Eric & Traci
