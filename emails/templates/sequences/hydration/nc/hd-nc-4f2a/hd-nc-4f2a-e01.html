Hi,

We want to clear up a concern that comes up quietly for many people:

Paying attention to your body does **not** create symptoms.

Sometimes, once things slow down, sensations that were already there become easier to notice. That doesn’t mean something new is wrong — it means the noise level has dropped.

Awareness is not danger.
Noticing is not worsening.

This phase can feel strange if you’re used to pushing through or ignoring signals just to get through the day. But nothing you’re feeling now was caused by paying attention.

You don’t need to fix anything.
You don’t need to analyze every sensation.

Just notice — and let it pass if it does.

Check in gently with yourself:

Right now, does your body feel:

• A little steadier or clearer
• About the same
• More noticeable or sensitive

Whatever your answer, it’s okay.

With care,
Eric & Traci
