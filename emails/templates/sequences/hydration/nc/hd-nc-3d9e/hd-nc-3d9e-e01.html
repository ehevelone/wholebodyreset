Hello,

We want to give you permission for something many people don’t realize they need:

You are allowed to stay in hydration longer.

You don’t have to progress.
You don’t have to unlock anything.
You don’t have to earn the next step.

Stability is the goal here.

Some bodies need more time before they’re ready for anything else — and that’s wisdom, not delay.

Check in gently with yourself today:

Does your body feel:

• Slightly better or more grounded  
• About the same  
• Worse or harder to manage  

Your answer tells us whether it’s best to stay, adjust, or protect.

We’ll meet you where you are.

— Eric & Traci
