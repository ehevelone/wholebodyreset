Hi,

If hydration has made you feel more tired, foggy, anxious, or sensitive, we want to be very clear:

That is not a failure.

It usually means your body needs less stimulation — not more.

Sometimes hydration reveals stress or depletion that was being held together quietly before. When that happens, the correct response is to slow down, not push through.

If anything feels worse, escalation is not the next step.

Pause is.

Please check in honestly with yourself:

Which feels closest right now?

• I feel okay or slightly better  
• I feel unchanged  
• I feel worse or more reactive  

If things feel worse, we’ll guide you toward a gentler path designed for sensitive systems.

You’re not alone in this.

With care,  
Eric & Traci
