Hi,

If hydration still feels uneventful, we want you to know this is very common.

Some bodies don’t announce progress.
They settle first.

That settling might look like fewer crashes, slightly calmer mornings, or less reactivity — even if it’s subtle.

This is a good time to slow your thinking down and listen instead of searching for signs.

Nothing new is required from you.

Just keep doing what you’re doing.

Take a moment and ask yourself:

Right now, would you say you feel:

• A little more stable than before  
• Mostly unchanged  
• More uncomfortable or sensitive  

Your answer helps guide what comes next — without rushing you.

Warmly,  
Eric & Traci
