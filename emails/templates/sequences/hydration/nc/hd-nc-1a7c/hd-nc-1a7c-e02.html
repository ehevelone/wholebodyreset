Hello again,

We want to share something that often gets overlooked:

“No change” is still information.

It can mean your body is conserving energy, buffering deeper systems, or working below the surface before anything noticeable appears.

Many people leave hydration too early because nothing dramatic happens.

But often, this phase is what allows the next phase to work more smoothly.

You don’t need to adjust anything yet.

Just keep hydration steady and gentle.

As you think back over the last few days, check in honestly:

Which feels most true right now?

• I feel a little steadier or slightly better  
• I feel about the same  
• I feel worse, more tired, or more sensitive  

There’s no right answer here — only useful information.

We’re here with you,  
Eric & Traci
