Hi,

In overstressed or sensitive phases, the goal is not forward movement.

The goal is protection.

Protecting energy.
Protecting stability.
Protecting capacity.

Trying to “keep up” during these moments often backfires — not because you’re weak, but because the body is already using its resources to stay balanced.

Choosing to protect yourself is not a delay.
It’s wisdom.

Nothing needs to be decided right now.
Nothing needs to be advanced.

Just being gentle with yourself today is enough.

As you pause, notice:

Does your body feel:

• A little more contained or held
• About the same
• Still on edge or fragile

Wherever you are, it’s okay to stay there.

We’re walking with you,
Eric & Traci
