Hi,

When the body is sensitive, even small choices can feel heavy.

Questions like “Should I continue?” or “Am I doing this right?” can start to create pressure — and pressure is the last thing an overstressed system needs.

You are not meant to solve this on your own.

Some people are comfortable holding steady without interpretation.
Others feel relief when they don’t have to guess.

If at any point you feel unsure about what your body is asking for — or worried about making things worse by guessing — guidance can help reduce that burden.

That’s why we offer AI-Guided Foundations:
not to push progress, but to help clarify what’s supportive right now and what’s better left alone.

There’s no obligation.
There’s no rush.
And staying exactly where you are is always allowed.

For now, just notice:

Do you feel:

• Okay holding steady
• Unsure but not distressed
• Overwhelmed and wanting support

Whatever your answer, you’re supported.

With care,
Eric & Traci
