Hi,

When the body feels overstimulated, the instinct is often to search for something to fix it.

But sometimes, the most supportive response is to **reduce**, not add.

Slowing down is not giving up.
It’s listening.

Overstressed systems don’t benefit from more information, more strategies, or more effort. They benefit from space, predictability, and gentleness.

If you’ve been feeling reactive or fragile, you haven’t missed a step.
You’ve reached a point where protection matters more than progress.

Nothing needs to change right now.

Just staying steady is enough.

Take a quiet moment and notice:

Do you feel:

• A little safer or more settled
• About the same
• Still very sensitive or overwhelmed

All of these responses are okay.

We’ll continue at your pace,
Eric & Traci
