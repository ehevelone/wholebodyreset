Hi,

If things feel overwhelming, intense, or harder to manage right now, we want you to hear this clearly:

Nothing has gone wrong.

When the body is overstressed or sensitive, even supportive changes can feel like too much — not because they’re wrong, but because the system is already operating at its limit.

This isn’t failure.
It’s information.

Your body may be asking for less input, less effort, and less expectation — not more fixing.

You don’t need to push.
You don’t need to power through.
You don’t need to figure anything out today.

Just allowing yourself to slow down is enough for now.

Check in gently with yourself:

Right now, would you say you feel:

• Slightly calmer or steadier
• About the same
• More overwhelmed or sensitive

Wherever you are, we’re here with you.

With care,
Eric & Traci
