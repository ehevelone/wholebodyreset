Hi,

There’s something important we want to normalize:

When the body is overstressed, even supportive inputs can feel like too much.

This doesn’t mean hydration is wrong.
It doesn’t mean you should try harder.
It doesn’t mean you’ve failed.

It means your system may need **less stimulation overall** — including less thinking about healing.

That’s not avoidance.
That’s regulation.

You don’t need to evaluate every sensation.
You don’t need to monitor yourself closely.
You don’t need to make decisions today.

Resting your attention can be just as supportive as resting your body.

Check in gently:

Right now, would you say you feel:

• Slightly calmer
• About the same
• Still very overstimulated

Whatever the answer, you’re not doing this wrong.

With warmth,
Eric & Traci
