Hello again.

As you continue, we want to offer a little guidance on what actually matters right now.

At this stage, the most important thing you can do is observe.

Not analyze.
Not judge.
Just notice.

Hydration may affect how you feel during the day,
how you sleep,
how your digestion responds,
or how emotionally steady you feel.

It may also feel completely neutral.

That doesn’t mean it isn’t working.

Often, the first sign of progress is a reduction in chaos — not a dramatic improvement.

Try not to watch your body too closely.
Let patterns emerge over time.

You don’t need to track anything.
You don’t need to report anything.
This information is for you.

For now, you’re exactly where you need to be.

Warmly,  
Eric & Traci  
ET Naturals
