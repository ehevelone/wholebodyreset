Hi — just checking in.

We want to set a few expectations here, gently and honestly.

Guided Foundations is not a program you “push through.”
It’s a framework you move within.

You may notice changes quickly.
You may notice very little at first.
You may even feel like nothing is happening.

All of those experiences are normal.

This work isn’t about chasing symptoms or forcing outcomes.
It’s about building stability so your body can respond when it’s ready.

If at any point you feel overwhelmed, confused, or unsure, that’s not a failure.
It’s information.

You’re allowed to slow down.
You’re allowed to pause.
You’re allowed to stay where you are.

Hydration is support — not a demand.

We’ll remind you of that as often as you need.

With care,  
Eric & Traci
