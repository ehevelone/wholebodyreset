Welcome,

This is the beginning of the hydration phase.

In this program, hydration is not treated as a quick fix or a task to optimize. It’s a way of supporting the body’s basic stability before anything more demanding is considered.

Hydration affects:
• mineral balance
• circulation and lymph movement
• nervous system signaling
• the body’s ability to tolerate change

That’s why it comes first.

This is not about drinking more.
It’s not about pushing volume.
And it’s not about chasing symptoms.

For now, hydration is simply something to **approach gently and consistently**, while paying attention to how your body responds over time.

There is nothing you need to adjust today.
Nothing to perfect.
Nothing to rush.

Your only focus right now is orientation — understanding how this phase works and giving your body the space to settle.

You’ll receive gentle check-ins every few days to help you observe, not evaluate.

Move slowly.
Let consistency do the work.
Your body will tell you when it’s ready for anything else.
