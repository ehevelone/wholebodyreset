Hi — checking in,

At this point, hydration has had some time to settle in.
Nothing needs to change yet, but it’s helpful to pause and notice.

How does hydration feel for you right now?

👉 I feel a little better or more stable

👉 Nothing really feels different yet

👉 I feel worse, overstimulated, or more sensitive

There’s no correct answer.
This simply helps us support your body where it actually is.

We’re glad you’re listening to it.
