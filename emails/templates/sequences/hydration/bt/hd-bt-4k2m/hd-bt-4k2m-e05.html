Hello again,

If hydration feels helpful but not dramatic, that’s okay.
Many people benefit from staying in this phase longer than they expect.

There is no prize for moving ahead quickly.
There is no penalty for moving slowly.

Your body sets the timeline — not the program.

Let’s check in again and see where things land today.

How does hydration feel right now?

👉 I feel a little better or more stable

👉 Nothing really feels different yet

👉 I feel worse, overstimulated, or more sensitive

Wherever you land is fine.
We’ll meet you there.
