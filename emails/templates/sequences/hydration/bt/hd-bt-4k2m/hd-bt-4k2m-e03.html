Hello again,

One of the hardest parts of healing is learning to trust slower progress.

We’re conditioned to believe that if we’re not advancing, we’re falling behind.
That simply isn’t true here.

In Guided Foundations, stability *is* progress.

If hydration feels neutral, calm, or quietly supportive — that’s often a good sign.
It means your body isn’t being overstimulated.

You’re not behind.
You’re not missing anything.
You’re doing exactly what this phase is designed for.

In the next check-in, we’ll ask a gentle question to help guide what comes next.

— Eric & Traci
