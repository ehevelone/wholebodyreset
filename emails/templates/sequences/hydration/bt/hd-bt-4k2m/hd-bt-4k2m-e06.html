Hi from Eric and Traci,

Before we move further, we want to leave you with this reassurance:

Healing doesn’t start with intensity.
It starts with stability.

Hydration is laying the groundwork — even if it feels quiet.
Even if it feels slow.
Even if you expected more by now.

Let’s do one more gentle check-in before anything shifts.

How does hydration feel today?

👉 I feel a little better or more stable

👉 Nothing really feels different yet

👉 I feel worse, overstimulated, or more sensitive  
https://etnaturals.com/wholebodyreset/hydration/os/hd-os-7m2p.html

Wherever you are, you’re doing this the right way.
