Hi again,

We wanted to check in and say this clearly:

You do not need dramatic symptoms improving to be “doing this right.”

Sometimes early progress looks like:
• fewer crashes
• slightly steadier mornings
• less intensity overall
• or just fewer bad days

Those changes count.

Your body may be rebuilding quietly — below the surface — before anything obvious shows up.

For now, keep hydration simple.
Don’t add new protocols.
Don’t chase results.

Just notice how your body responds when it’s supported instead of pushed.

We’ll check in again soon.

— Eric & Traci
