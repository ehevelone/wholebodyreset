Hello from Eric and Traci at ET Naturals,

We want to reassure you of something right away:

There is nothing you need to fix.
Nothing you need to push.
Nothing you need to “do right.”

You’ve entered Guided Foundations — a slow, body-led program designed to restore stability before anything aggressive is attempted.

For now, the goal is simple: create enough steadiness for your body to feel safe again.

That’s why we always begin with hydration.
Not as a trend.
Not as a detox.
But because every system depends on it — minerals, lymph, liver, nervous system, and overall capacity.

If you’ve noticed even a *slight* improvement lately, that’s enough to begin here.

Move gently.
Observe more than you act.
We’ll guide you from here.

— Eric & Traci
