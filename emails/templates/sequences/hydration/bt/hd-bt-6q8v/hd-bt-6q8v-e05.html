Hello again,

We want to reassure you of something important:

There is no advantage to rushing this phase.

Some bodies respond quickly.
Others take longer to feel changes.
Both are normal, and both are intelligent responses.

If hydration feels neutral or uneventful, that doesn’t mean it isn’t helping.
It often means your system is prioritizing stability first.

Let’s check in again and let your body guide what comes next.

How does hydration feel for you today?

👉 I’m feeling a little better or more stable

👉 Nothing really feels different yet  
https://etnaturals.com/wholebodyreset/hydration/nc/hd-nc-1a7c.html

👉 I feel worse, overstimulated, or more sensitive  
https://etnaturals.com/wholebodyreset/hydration/os/hd-os-7m2p.html

There’s nothing you need to “figure out.”
Just notice, and we’ll take care of the rest.
