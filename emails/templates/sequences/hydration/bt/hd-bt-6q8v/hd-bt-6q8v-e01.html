Hello from Eric and Traci,

We wanted to check in with you today — not to push you forward, and not to rush anything — just to see how your body is responding.

By now, you’ve had some time with hydration.
Not a long time. Not “enough” time.
Just some time.

And that’s all we’re looking for right now.

This stage isn’t about results or milestones.
It’s about noticing.

Some people feel lighter or calmer.
Some people feel exactly the same.
Some people feel a little off or more sensitive.

All of those are normal.

What matters is that we follow your body’s lead, not a schedule.

So take a moment and check in with yourself.

How does hydration feel so far?

👉 I’m feeling a little better or more stable
(link → hydration/bt/hd-bt-4k2m.html)

👉 Nothing really feels different yet
(link → hydration/nc/hd-nc-1a7c.html)

👉 I feel worse, overstimulated, or more sensitive
(link → hydration/os/hd-os-7m2p.html)

Just click the option that feels closest.
There’s no wrong answer — and nothing bad happens either way.

Wherever you land, we’ll meet you there and adjust gently.

Move at your own pace.
There’s nothing to catch up on.
Nothing to fall behind on.

You’re doing this exactly the way it’s meant to be done.

We’re really glad you’re here.
