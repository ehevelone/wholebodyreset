Hi — checking in again,

One thing we’ve learned over the years is that healing doesn’t always feel dramatic.

Often, the most important changes are subtle:
a calmer nervous system,
slightly more consistent days,
less reactivity than before.

These aren’t things most programs talk about —
but they’re signs the foundation is working.

Let’s pause again and see what your body is telling you.

How does hydration feel right now?

👉 I’m feeling a little better or more stable

👉 Nothing really feels different yet

👉 I feel worse, overstimulated, or more sensitive

Whatever you notice is useful information — not a judgment.

You’re doing this exactly the way it’s meant to be done.

Warmly,  
Eric & Traci
