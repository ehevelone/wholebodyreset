This is a gentle check-in.

If your system has felt overwhelmed, sensitive, or easily pushed too far in the past, hydration needs to be approached carefully.

Nothing here is meant to be forced.

Hydration is not about volume.
It’s about tolerance.

For now, the goal is simply to observe:
How does your body respond to small, steady inputs?
Do you feel calmer, steadier, or more supported — or does your body ask for less?

There is no “right” amount.
There is only feedback.

If you haven’t already, you may want to revisit the orientation page as a reminder of how this program is meant to work.

Move slowly.
Pause when needed.
Your body sets the pace.
