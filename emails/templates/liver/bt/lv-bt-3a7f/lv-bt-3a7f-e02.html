              <p>Hello,</p>

              <p>
                As liver support begins, it’s helpful to understand what this phase
                is meant to feel like — and what it isn’t.
              </p>

              <p>
                Liver support does not need to feel intense, dramatic, or cleansing
                to be effective.
              </p>

              <p>
                In fact, strong reactions are often a sign that the system is being
                asked to do more than it can comfortably handle.
              </p>

              <p>
                Supportive liver work usually feels quiet:
                a little more steadiness, fewer energy swings, or slightly improved
                tolerance overall.
              </p>

              <p>
                You may also notice very little at first.
                That doesn’t mean nothing is happening.
              </p>

              <p>
                The liver often responds by stabilizing internal processes before
                anything obvious shows up on the surface.
              </p>

              <p>
                There’s nothing to change right now.
                Just continue observing gently.
              </p>
