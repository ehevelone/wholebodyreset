              <p>Hi,</p>

              <p>
                We want to clear up a concern that comes up quietly for many people:
              </p>

              <p>
                Paying attention to your body does <strong>not</strong> create symptoms.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sometimes, once things slow down, sensations that were already there become easier to notice.
                That doesn’t mean something new is wrong — it means the noise level has dropped.
              </p>

              <p>
                Awareness is not danger.<br>
                Noticing is not worsening.
              </p>

              <p>
                This phase can feel strange if you’re used to pushing through or ignoring signals just to get through the day.
                But nothing you’re feeling now was caused by paying attention.
              </p>

              <p>
                You don’t need to fix anything.<br>
                You don’t need to analyze every sensation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Just notice — and let it pass if it does.
              </p>

              <p>
                Check in gently with yourself:
              </p>

              <p>
                Right now, does your body feel:
              </p>

              <p>
                • A little steadier or clearer<br>
                • About the same<br>
                • More noticeable or sensitive
              </p>

              <p>
                Whatever your answer, it’s okay.
              </p>

              <p>
                With care,<br>
                Eric &amp; Traci
              </p>
