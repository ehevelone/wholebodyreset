              <p>Hi,</p>

              <p>
                If hydration has made you feel more tired, foggy, anxious, or sensitive,
                we want to be very clear:
              </p>

              <p>
                That is not a failure.
              </p>

              <p>
                It usually means your body needs less stimulation — not more.
              </p>

              <p>
                Sometimes hydration reveals stress or depletion that was being held together quietly before.
                When that happens, the correct response is to slow down, not push through.
              </p>

              <p>
                If anything feels worse, escalation is not the next step.
              </p>

              <p>
                Pause is.
              </p>

              <p>
                Please check in honestly with yourself:
              </p>

              <p>
                Which feels closest right now?
              </p>

              <p>
                • I feel okay or slightly better<br>
                • I feel unchanged<br>
                • I feel worse or more reactive
              </p>

              <p>
                If things feel worse, we’ll guide you toward a gentler path designed for sensitive systems.
              </p>

              <p>
                You’re not alone in this.
              </p>

              <p>
                With care,<br>
                Eric &amp; Traci
              </p>
