              <p>Hello from Eric and Traci at ET Naturals,</p>

              <p>
                We want to start by saying this clearly:
              </p>

              <p>
                If you haven’t felt much change yet, that does not mean hydration isn’t working —
                and it definitely doesn’t mean you’re doing anything wrong.
              </p>

              <p>
                For many people, hydration is one of the quietest phases of healing.
                The body may be using this time to stabilize minerals, fluid balance,
                nervous system signaling, or internal pressure before anything obvious shows up.
              </p>

              <p>
                That can feel frustrating, especially when you’re being consistent.
              </p>

              <p>
                But this stage matters.
              </p>

              <p>
                Right now, your only job is to keep going gently, exactly as you are.
              </p>

              <p>
                No adding.<br>
                No pushing.<br>
                No fixing.
              </p>

              <p>
                Just hydration, consistency, and observation.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before we move on, take a quiet moment and check in with yourself:
              </p>

              <p>
                How does your body feel overall right now?
              </p>

              <p>
                • A little better or more stable<br>
                • About the same as when you started<br>
                • Worse, more sensitive, or overwhelmed
              </p>

              <p>
                You don’t need to decide anything yet. Just notice.
              </p>

              <p>
                We’ll guide you from here.
              </p>

              <p>
                With care,<br>
                Eric &amp; Traci
              </p>
