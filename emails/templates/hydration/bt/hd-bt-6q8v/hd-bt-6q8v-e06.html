              <p>Hi from Eric and Traci,</p>

              <p>
                As we wrap up this stretch of hydration support, we want to say this clearly:
              </p>

              <p>
                You’re allowed to stay right here.
              </p>

              <p>
                Hydration isn’t a box to check off.<br>
                It’s a foundation you can lean on for as long as your body wants it.
              </p>

              <p>
                Some people naturally feel ready to move forward.<br>
                Others benefit from staying here longer.<br>
                Neither path is better — they’re just different.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before anything else happens, let’s check in one more time.
              </p>

              <p>
                How does hydration feel for you now?
              </p>
