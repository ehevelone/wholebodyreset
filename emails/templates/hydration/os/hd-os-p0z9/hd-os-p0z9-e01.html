            <p>Hi,</p>

            <p>
              When the body is sensitive, even small choices can feel heavy.
            </p>

            <p>
              Questions like “Should I continue?” or “Am I doing this right?”
              can start to create pressure — and pressure is the last thing an overstressed system needs.
            </p>

            <p>
              You are not meant to solve this on your own.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some people are comfortable holding steady without interpretation.<br>
              Others feel relief when they don’t have to guess.
            </p>

            <p>
              If at any point you feel unsure about what your body is asking for —
              or worried about making things worse by guessing —
              guidance can help reduce that burden.
            </p>

            <p>
              That’s why we offer AI-Guided Foundations:<br>
              not to push progress, but to help clarify what’s supportive right now
              and what’s better left alone.
            </p>

            <p>
              There’s no obligation.<br>
              There’s no rush.<br>
              And staying exactly where you are is always allowed.
            </p>

            <p>
              For now, just notice:
            </p>

            <p>
              Do you feel:
            </p>

            <p>
              • Okay holding steady<br>
              • Unsure but not distressed<br>
              • Overwhelmed and wanting support
            </p>

            <p>
              Whatever your answer, you’re supported.
            </p>

            <p>
              With care,<br>
              Eric &amp; Traci
            </p>
