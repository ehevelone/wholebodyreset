<h1>Program Expectations</h1>

<p>
Before we begin, it’s important to clarify what Guided Foundations is —
and what it isn’t.
</p>

<p>
This program is intentionally structured to move slowly, in sequence,
and with respect for your body’s current capacity.
That pacing is not a limitation.
It’s the reason the program works.
</p>

<h2>This is not a “push through” program</h2>

<p>
Guided Foundations is not about forcing detox, overriding symptoms,
or rushing toward results.
</p>

<p>
If your body has been under strain — from stress, illness, long-term symptoms,
or repeated attempts to “fix” things — pushing harder usually backfires.
</p>

<p>
Here, symptoms are treated as information.
They help guide timing, dosage, and direction.
</p>

<h2>You will not be asked to do everything at once</h2>

<p>
At the beginning, you will notice something that may feel unfamiliar:
very little is required of you.
</p>

<p>
That’s intentional.
</p>

<p>
Before adding supplements, minerals, or structured protocols,
your body needs stability.
That starts with hydration and observation.
</p>

<p>
Each phase builds on the one before it.
Skipping ahead tends to create confusion, setbacks, or unnecessary discomfort.
</p>

<h2>Progress is measured by response, not speed</h2>

<p>
In this program, progress does not mean:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Doing more</li>
  <li>Adding faster</li>
  <li>Reaching the next phase quickly</li>
</ul>

<p>
Progress means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your body tolerates changes without backlash</li>
  <li>Symptoms become more predictable</li>
  <li>Recovery improves</li>
  <li>You gain clarity about what helps and what doesn’t</li>
</ul>

<p>
For some people, this happens quickly.
For others, it takes patience.
Both are normal.
</p>

<h2>Emails are part of the structure</h2>

<p>
Guidance in Guided Foundations is delivered gradually by email.
This is intentional.
</p>

<p>
It prevents overload, keeps focus on the current step,
and gives your body time to respond before moving forward.
</p>

<p>
If you try to jump ahead without receiving guidance,
you may miss important context that protects your progress.
</p>

<h2>A note about expectations and mindset</h2>

<p>
It’s common to want relief immediately.
Especially if you’ve been dealing with symptoms for a long time.
</p>

<p>
This program does not promise instant change.
What it offers instead is a process that is sustainable,
repeatable, and responsive to your body.
</p>

<p>
Many people are surprised to find that slowing down —
and respecting the sequence —
leads to steadier improvement than anything they’ve tried before.
</p>

<h2>What happens next</h2>

<p>
For now, your only job is observation.
</p>

<p>
Notice how you feel.
Notice your energy, digestion, sleep, and stress response.
You’re not trying to fix anything yet.
You’re establishing a baseline.
</p>

<p>
You’ll receive guidance by email when it’s time to begin hydration.
Until then, rest, observe, and trust the process.
</p>
