  <h1>Program Expectations</h1>

  <p>
    Before moving forward, it’s important to understand how Guided Foundations
    is designed to work.
  </p>

  <p>
    This program follows a deliberate sequence.
    Each phase builds on the one before it, and the order matters.
  </p>

  <h2>This is a paced, structured program</h2>

  <p>
    Guided Foundations is not designed to be completed quickly.
    It is designed to be completed safely and sustainably.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many people arrive here after trying to do too much, too fast —
    adding supplements, protocols, or detox strategies
    before their system was ready.
  </p>

  <p>
    This program takes a different approach.
  </p>

  <h2>Doing less at first is intentional</h2>

  <p>
    At the beginning, very little is asked of you.
  </p>

  <p>
    That is not because nothing is happening —
    it’s because stability comes before change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rushing ahead often creates new symptoms,
    confusion about what’s helping,
    or the feeling that nothing is working.
  </p>

  <p>
    Slowing down prevents that.
  </p>

  <h2>Guidance is delivered gradually</h2>

  <p>
    You’ll receive guidance by email as you move through the program.
    This pacing is intentional.
  </p>

  <p>
    It keeps your focus on the current step,
    prevents overload,
    and gives your body time to respond
    before anything new is introduced.
  </p>

  <p>
    Skipping ahead usually creates more noise,
    not more progress.
  </p>

  <h2>Progress looks different for everyone</h2>

  <p>
    There is no universal timeline.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some people notice subtle changes early.
    Others need more time for their system to settle.
    Both are normal.
  </p>

  <p>
    The goal is not speed —
    it’s consistency, clarity, and tolerance.
  </p>

  <h2>Before anything is added</h2>

  <p>
    Before hydration guidance begins,
    there is one important step:
    learning how to observe your body
    without trying to fix or change it.
  </p>

  <p>
    This baseline is what everything else depends on.
  </p>

  <p>
    When you’re ready, continue here:
