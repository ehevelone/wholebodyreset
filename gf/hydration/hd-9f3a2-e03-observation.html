  <h1>Observation Comes First</h1>

  <p>
    Before adding anything — water, minerals, supplements —
    your first job is simply to notice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Most of us are used to pushing through discomfort
    or trying to override symptoms.
    This program works differently.
  </p>

  <p>
    Symptoms aren’t enemies here.
    They’re information.
  </p>

  <h2>What to pay attention to</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Your energy throughout the day</li>
    <li>How you sleep and how you wake up</li>
    <li>Digestion and appetite</li>
    <li>Thirst and fluid tolerance</li>
    <li>Stress response and recovery</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    You’re not trying to fix any of this yet.
    You’re learning what “normal” looks like for you right now.
  </p>

  <p>
    This baseline matters.
    It helps you recognize when something is helping —
    and when something is simply too much.
  </p>

  <h2>A note from us</h2>

  <p>
    We want you to know this program wasn’t created from theory alone.
  </p>

  <p>
    We’ve followed this process ourselves.
    We’re still on the health journey right alongside you.
  </p>

  <p>
    And honestly — this part was hard for us too.
  </p>

  <p>
    Especially for Traci, there was a strong urge to rush ahead,
    to get to the next step,
    to fix everything as quickly as possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    What surprised us was how much better things started to feel
    when we slowed down and actually followed the structure.
  </p>

  <p>
    Observation, patience, and restraint weren’t setbacks —
    they were the reason the program worked as well as it did.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you find yourself wanting to jump ahead,
    know that you’re not doing anything wrong.
    That impulse is common.
  </p>

  <p>
    But staying here,
    letting your system settle,
    and moving forward only when it feels right
    is exactly how real progress happens.
  </p>

  <p>
    You’ll receive guidance by email when it’s time to begin hydration.
    Until then, observe, rest, and trust the process.
  </p>

  <p>
    — Eric &amp; Traci
