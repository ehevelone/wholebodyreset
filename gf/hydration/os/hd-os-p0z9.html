  <h1>This Is a Good Place to Pause</h1>

  <p class="gentle">
    Pausing does not mean you are behind.
    It means your body is communicating.
  </p>

  <p>
    If hydration has felt inconsistent, uncomfortable,
    or difficult to stabilize,
    the most supportive step is often to stop pushing
    and allow the system to settle.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p>
      Hydration is not meant to feel forced.
      It is meant to restore balance and safety.
    </p>

    <p class="gentle">
      Holding steady here protects your nervous system
      and prevents unnecessary stress.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    At this stage, hydration has done its job —
    it has revealed what the body needs next.
  </p>

  <p class="gentle">
    For many people, the next layer is not more water,
    but better mineral balance.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>When Extra Support Can Be Helpful</strong></p>

    <p>
      If you’ve been moving gently, listening carefully,
      and still feel consistently worse rather than supported,
      this may be a sign that your body needs more individualized guidance.
    </p>

    <p class="gentle">
      This does not mean Foundations has failed —
      it means your body may benefit from personalized support.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some people choose to work alongside a:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Functional or integrative practitioner</li>
      <li>Clinical herbalist</li>
      <li>Licensed healthcare provider familiar with complex or chronic patterns</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="gentle">
      Education builds awareness.
      Individual care provides customization.
      Both can work together.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Continuing to Learn Still Matters</strong></p>

    <p>
      Even when your body needs individualized support,
      understanding what’s happening inside it is still valuable.
    </p>

    <p class="gentle">
      Knowledge doesn’t replace care —
      it gives you language, clarity, and confidence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many people find that continuing to read,
      reflect, and learn helps them:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ask better questions</li>
      <li>Notice patterns sooner</li>
      <li>Advocate for themselves more clearly</li>
      <li>Move forward with less fear and confusion</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="gentle">
      Education is not something you “fail.”
      It’s something you carry with you.
