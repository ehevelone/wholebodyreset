  <h1>Before Hydration Begins</h1>

  <p>
    It may feel surprising that hydration isn’t introduced immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    After all, hydration sounds simple —
    and many people assume more water is always better.
  </p>

  <p>
    In reality, how your body responds to fluids right now
    determines how hydration should be approached.
  </p>

  <h2>Why we don’t rush hydration</h2>

  <p>
    When the body has been under stress,
    dealing with symptoms,
    or adapting to long-term imbalance,
    even basic inputs like water can feel unpredictable.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some people feel better with more fluids.
    Others experience bloating, pressure, fatigue, or discomfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    That response matters.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rushing hydration without understanding your baseline
    often leads to confusion —
    or the belief that “hydration doesn’t work for me.”
  </p>

  <h2>What this short window is for</h2>

  <p>
    For a brief period,
    nothing new is added.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead, you’re giving your system a chance to show
    how it currently handles fluids, meals, rest, and daily rhythm.
  </p>

  <p>
    This creates a reference point that allows hydration guidance
    to be introduced more accurately —
    and with fewer surprises.
  </p>

  <h2>What you should (and shouldn’t) do right now</h2>

  <p>
    You are not being asked to track, measure, or change anything.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simply notice:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>When you feel thirsty</li>
    <li>How you feel after drinking plain water</li>
    <li>Whether fluids affect bloating, fullness, or energy</li>
    <li>How hydration seems to influence sleep or recovery</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    There are no targets to hit
    and no rules to follow yet.
  </p>

  <h2>What happens next</h2>

  <p>
    Hydration guidance will arrive by email.
  </p>

  <p>
    It will build on what your body is already showing,
    rather than forcing a one-size-fits-all approach.
  </p>

  <p>
    Until then, observation is enough.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you haven’t already,
    make sure you’ve reviewed the observation step here:
