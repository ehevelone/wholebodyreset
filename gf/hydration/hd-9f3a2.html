  <h1>Hydration & Mineral-Supported Water</h1>

  <p class="gentle">
    This page is part of the Guided Foundations program.
    Hydration is not a warm-up step — it is the foundation that makes all other progress possible.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Hydration Comes First</h2>

  <p>
    Before binders, before herbs, before parasite, metal, EBV,
    or thyroid-focused strategies, the body must first regain
    the ability to hold and use hydration.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many people drink water all day and remain dehydrated at the cellular level.
    Without sufficient minerals, water passes through the body
    without entering tissues, lymph, or detox pathways.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Hydration Is Required Before All Other Protocols</strong></p>
    <p>
      When hydration is not established, detox pathways stall,
      symptoms intensify, and progress becomes unstable.
      This is why hydration is placed first — not as an option,
      but as a prerequisite.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Why This Is the Only Hydration Method We Use</h2>

  <p>
    This hydration approach exists because everything else failed.
    Years of fragmented advice — a tip here, a reel there,
    conflicting opinions and “detox hacks” —
    created confusion instead of healing.
  </p>

  <p>
    This method emerged out of frustration,
    trial, failure, and finally resolution.
    It is the exact hydration approach that restored clarity,
    stability, and resilience for both Eric and Traci
    when nothing else worked.
  </p>

  <p class="gentle">
    We are not sharing this as theory.
    We are sharing it because it rebuilt the foundation
    that made all other healing possible.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>This Is Not a Menu of Options</strong></p>
    <p>
      We intentionally do not offer multiple hydration formulas,
      competing electrolyte strategies, or alternative methods.
      Searching for a “better” hydration protocol often recreates
      the same chaos that prevented healing in the first place.
    </p>
    <p class="gentle">
      This works because it is simple,
      repeatable, and consistent — not because it is aggressive.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Mineral-Supported Hydration (How We Did It)</h2>

  <div class="image-box">
    <img
      src="/images/ph-mineral-water.jpg"
      alt="Pink Himalayan salt mineral concentrate with salt settled at the bottom"
    >
    <div class="image-caption">
      Mineral concentrate after settling. This concentrate is always diluted before use.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Plain water was not enough.
    Mineral-supported hydration allowed water
    to enter the cells instead of flushing straight through.
  </p>

  <p>
    A simple mineral concentrate made with filtered water
    and pink Himalayan salt became the turning point —
    supporting lymph flow, detox capacity,
    and nervous system stability.
  </p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p><strong>Important Safety Note</strong></p>
    <p>
      The mineral concentrate is never consumed directly.
      It is diluted into a larger volume of drinking water.
      Taken alone, it can be overly stimulating.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Implementation Details (Parts of One System)</h2>

  <p>
    The pages below document the exact components of the hydration method
    we personally used. These are not alternatives or upgrades —
    they are supporting pieces of the same foundation.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/recipes/hydration/rc-hd-sole.html">
        Pink Himalayan Mineral Concentrate (Sole Water)
      </a>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="/recipes/hydration/rc-hd-electrolyte.html">
        Mineral-Supported Hydration Tea
      </a>
      <span class="gentle"> (supportive, not a replacement)</span>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Adjusting Without Changing the Method</h2>

  <p>
    If hydration ever feels too stimulating,
    the answer is almost always to slow down —
    not to switch strategies.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Smaller amounts</li>
    <li>More space between sips</li>
    <li>Gentler pacing</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="gentle">
    This is not about doing more.
    It is about allowing the body to relearn stability.
