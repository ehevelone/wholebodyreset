  <h1>Metals — Educational Sourcing</h1>

  <p class="orientation">
    This page provides educational background and sourcing context as part of
    <em>Whole Body Reset – Guided Foundations</em>.
    Nothing on this page is instructional, prescriptive, or protocol-based.
  </p>

  <h2>What “Metals” Refer To</h2>
  <p>
    In environmental, industrial, and biological literature, the term “metals”
    refers to a broad category of naturally occurring elements.
    Certain metals are discussed in health, ecological, and occupational contexts
    due to their persistence and interaction with biological systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Metals in Terrain-Based Discussions</h2>
  <p>
    Terrain-focused and systems-based models often examine metals
    as one of many environmental variables that may influence
    physiological balance over time.
    This perspective appears in historical, ecological,
    and integrative frameworks rather than reductionist models.
  </p>

  <h2>Related Materials Commonly Referenced in Literature</h2>
  <p>
    Educational discussions of metals frequently reference
    mineral binders, algae, and other materials in a contextual manner.
    These references are descriptive only and do not imply guidance on use.
