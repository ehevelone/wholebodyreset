  <h1>Epstein–Barr Virus (EBV) — Educational Sourcing</h1>

  <p class="orientation">
    This page provides educational background and sourcing context as part of
    <em>Whole Body Reset – Guided Foundations</em>.

  <h2>What EBV Is</h2>
  <p>
    Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) is a member of the herpesvirus family and is one
    of the most common human viruses worldwide.
    It is widely discussed in medical, immunological, and epidemiological
    literature due to its prevalence and long-term persistence in the body.
  </p>

  <h2>EBV in Terrain-Based Literature</h2>
  <p>
    In terrain-focused and systems-based discussions, EBV is often examined
    in relation to overall immune environment, physiological stress,
    and host resilience rather than as an isolated factor.
    This perspective appears in historical, integrative,
    and ecological models of health.
  </p>

  <h2>Related Materials Commonly Referenced in Literature</h2>
  <p>
    Educational discussions of EBV frequently reference botanical,
    nutritional, and environmental materials in a contextual manner.
    These references are descriptive and informational only.
