  <h1>Parasites — Educational Sourcing</h1>

  <p class="orientation">
    This page provides educational background and sourcing context as part of
    <em>Whole Body Reset – Guided Foundations</em>.
    Nothing on this page is instructional, prescriptive, or protocol-based.
  </p>

  <h2>What “Parasites” Refer To</h2>
  <p>
    In biological and medical literature, the term “parasites” refers to
    a broad group of organisms that live in or on a host organism.
    These include protozoa, helminths, and other organisms discussed
    across parasitology, ecology, and global health research.
  </p>

  <h2>Parasites in Terrain-Based Discussions</h2>
  <p>
    Terrain-focused and systems-based models often examine parasites
    as part of a broader ecological picture that includes host environment,
    nutrient status, immune resilience, and external exposures.
    This perspective appears in historical, ecological,
    and integrative frameworks rather than isolated disease models.
  </p>

  <h2>Related Materials Commonly Referenced in Literature</h2>
  <p>
    Educational discussions of parasites frequently reference
    botanical, nutritional, and environmental materials in a contextual manner.
    These references are descriptive only and do not imply guidance on use.
