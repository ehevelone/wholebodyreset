<h1>Understanding the Terrain of the Body</h1>

<p class="gentle">
This page introduces the terrain framework used throughout Guided Foundations.
There is no expectation to act, detox, or change anything immediately.
</p>

<h2>The Problem Is Rarely the “Invader”</h2>

<p>
Modern health conversations often focus on what is found in the body.
Terrain-based models ask a different question:
<strong>why is the internal environment allowing certain patterns to persist?</strong>
</p>

<p>
This approach is commonly referred to as <strong>Terrain Theory</strong>.
It emphasizes the internal environment rather than isolated external factors.
</p>

<h2>What “Terrain” Refers To</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Hydration status</li>
  <li>Mineral availability</li>
  <li>Digestive and elimination function</li>
  <li>Lymphatic and drainage capacity</li>
  <li>Nervous system regulation</li>
  <li>Inflammatory load</li>
  <li>Stress and recovery balance</li>
</ul>

<p>
When the terrain is depleted or congested, the body becomes reactive.
When the terrain is supported, regulation often improves naturally.
</p>

<h2>Why Foundations Come First</h2>

<p>
Interventions introduced without adequate terrain support
often create overwhelm instead of progress.
Foundations exist to build capacity before complexity.

<div class="callout">
<p>
Progress is not measured by how quickly something changes,
but by how well the body tolerates what comes next.
