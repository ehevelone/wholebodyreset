  <h1>EBV Readiness Gate</h1>

  <p class="orientation">
    This page contains educational material from the
    <em>Whole Body Reset – Foundations</em> text.
    There is no requirement to implement anything here.
    Read and apply only what feels supportive.
  </p>

  <div class="content-block">

    <p class="gentle">
      This page is a checkpoint — not a starting line.
      EBV support is only effective when the body has sufficient capacity.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>
        EBV is not something to “kill.”
        It is something the body keeps in check when terrain,
        drainage, and nervous system regulation are stable.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Before Proceeding, the Following Must Be True</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Hydration is consistent and tolerated</li>
      <li>Mineral support is in place without overstimulation</li>
      <li>Binders are used regularly and tolerated</li>
      <li>Bowel movements are regular (1–2 daily)</li>
      <li>Parasite work has begun or parasite burden has been reduced</li>
      <li>Heavy metals are being handled quietly (no aggressive chelation)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="gentle">
      If any of these are unstable, EBV work will feel overwhelming —
      not helpful.
    </p>

    <h2>Why EBV Often Flares During Detox</h2>

    <p>
      EBV commonly reacts when the nervous system becomes overloaded.
      This can happen during parasite die-off, metal mobilization,
      emotional stress, or sleep disruption.
    </p>

    <p>
      A flare does not mean EBV is “winning.”
      It usually means the body exceeded its regulatory capacity.
    </p>

    <div class="callout">
      <p>
        In Guided Foundations, EBV flares are treated as
        <strong>regulation signals</strong>,
        not failures or emergencies.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>Signs You Are Ready to Proceed</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Symptoms are mild, stable, or improving</li>
      <li>You do not feel like you are constantly “detoxing”</li>
      <li>Sleep is reasonably predictable</li>
      <li>Anxiety is manageable or decreasing</li>
      <li>Energy crashes are less frequent</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="gentle">
      Quiet progress is the goal.
    </p>

    <h2>If You Are Not Ready Yet</h2>

    <p>
      That is not a setback.
      It means the body is asking for more support,
      not more intervention.
    </p>

    <p>
      Staying with hydration, minerals, binders,
      nervous system support, and gentle parasite reduction
      is productive EBV work — even if it doesn’t feel dramatic.
    </p>

    <h2>Next Step</h2>

    <p>
      When readiness is established,
      proceed to the EBV overview page
      to understand how EBV behaves in the body
      and how this program approaches it safely.
