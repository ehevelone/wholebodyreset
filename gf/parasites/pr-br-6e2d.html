<h1>Parasites in Context</h1>

<p class="orientation">
This section contains educational material from the
<em>Whole Body Reset – Foundations</em> text.
There is no requirement to take action here.
Read, reflect, and apply only what feels supportive.
</p>

<div class="content-block">

<h2>This Is Not a Diagnosis Section</h2>

<p>
Parasites are a normal part of the human ecosystem.
Their presence does not mean something is “wrong,”
and it does not automatically require intervention.
</p>

<p>
This section exists to provide context — not urgency.
</p>

<h2>Why Parasites Are Discussed at All</h2>

<p>
Parasites are often blamed for symptoms that actually stem from
deeper imbalances such as mineral depletion,
toxic load, nervous system stress, or impaired drainage.
</p>

<p>
Understanding parasites within that broader terrain
prevents fear-based decisions and unnecessary protocols.
</p>

<h2>No Action Is Required Here</h2>

<p>
Reading about parasites does <strong>not</strong> mean you need
to treat, cleanse, or “go after” anything.
</p>

<p>
For many people, simply restoring hydration,
minerals, sleep, and nervous system safety
reduces symptoms that were never parasite-driven to begin with.
</p>

<h2>Why Foundations Comes First</h2>

<p>
Parasite-focused work — when appropriate —
is safest and most effective
only after the body has sufficient support in place.
</p>

<p>
Foundations exists to ensure that any future steps,
if taken at all, are gentle, informed, and non-reactive.
</p>

<h2>How to Use This Section</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Read slowly</li>
  <li>Notice what resonates — and what doesn’t</li>
  <li>There is no need to label yourself</li>
  <li>There is no timeline to follow</li>
</ul>

<p>
Information is offered so you can make grounded decisions —
not so you feel pressure to act.
