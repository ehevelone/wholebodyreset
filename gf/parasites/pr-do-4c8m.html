<h1>Parasites as a Signal, Not a Cause</h1>

<p class="orientation">
This page contains educational material from the
<em>Whole Body Reset – Foundations</em> text.
There is no requirement to implement anything here.
Read and apply only what feels supportive.
</p>

<div class="content-block">

<h2>Parasites Respond to Terrain</h2>

<p>
Parasites do not randomly overpopulate a healthy system.
They tend to thrive in environments that are already stressed,
toxic, or depleted.
</p>

<p>
In this way, parasites are often a <strong>signal</strong> —
not the original cause.
</p>

<h2>The Terrain Concept</h2>

<p>
“Terrain” refers to the internal environment of the body:
minerals, hydration, detox pathways,
immune signaling, and nervous system regulation.
</p>

<p>
When the terrain is compromised,
parasites are more likely to persist.
When the terrain improves,
their influence often diminishes without direct intervention.
</p>

<h2>Why Killing Alone Rarely Works</h2>

<p>
Aggressive parasite protocols often fail because
they focus on elimination without restoring terrain.
</p>

<p>
Without proper drainage, binders, minerals, and nervous system support,
mobilizing organisms can increase symptoms rather than resolve them.
</p>

<h2>Parasites and Co-Factors</h2>

<p>
Parasites frequently coexist with other burdens,
such as heavy metals, ammonia, and chronic infections.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Metals can weaken immune surveillance</li>
  <li>Parasites can bind and store toxins</li>
  <li>Ammonia byproducts stress the nervous system</li>
</ul>

<p>
This is why parasite symptoms often overlap
with anxiety, brain fog, fatigue, and sleep disruption.
</p>

<h2>Why Foundations Addresses the Whole Picture</h2>

<p>
Foundations focuses on stabilizing the body first —
so that nothing needs to be forced.
</p>

<p>
For some people, that alone reduces parasite-related symptoms.
For others, it prepares the body for gentler, safer next steps.
</p>

<h2>A Grounding Reminder</h2>

<p>
Needing context does not mean you need treatment.
</p>

<p>
Information is here to reduce fear,
not to create a new identity or diagnosis.
