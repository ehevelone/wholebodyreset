<h1>Kidney Support — Recipes & Preparation</h1>

<p class="gentle">
This section is educational only.
Nothing here is required, prescribed, or intended to force function.
Kidney support works best when it is gentle, consistent, and non-stimulating.
</p>

<p>
The kidneys play a central role in fluid balance, mineral regulation,
acid–base balance, and nervous system stability.
When they are under strain, many systems feel it — fatigue, anxiety,
poor detox tolerance, and electrolyte imbalance are common signals.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>In Guided Foundations, kidney support is:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>hydrating rather than stimulating</li>
    <li>warming rather than depleting</li>
    <li>supportive rather than corrective</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>When Kidney Support May Be Helpful</h2>

<ul>
  <li>frequent dehydration despite drinking fluids</li>
  <li>poor tolerance to detox or cleansing</li>
  <li>electrolyte instability</li>
  <li>fatigue that improves with rest but returns quickly</li>
  <li>feeling “wired but tired”</li>
</ul>

<p class="gentle">
These are not diagnostic signs.
They are patterns that suggest the kidneys may benefit from support.
</p>

<h2>Simple Kidney Support Tea (Educational Example)</h2>

<p>
Herbal teas are one of the gentlest ways to support kidney function.
They provide hydration, mineral cofactors, and plant support
without forcing elimination.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Basic Kidney Support Tea</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>1–2 teaspoons dried nettle leaf</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon marshmallow root <em>(cold infusion preferred)</em></li>
    <li>Filtered water</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Combine herbs with water.
  For marshmallow root, allow to steep cold for several hours or overnight.
  Warm gently if desired.
  </p>

  <p class="gentle">
  This tea is intended to hydrate and soothe,
  not to stimulate urination.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Warming Kidney Broth (Food-Based Support)</h2>

<p>
Warm, mineral-rich broths help support the kidneys
by improving circulation, hydration uptake, and electrolyte balance.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Simple Kidney-Supportive Broth</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Filtered water</li>
    <li>Root vegetables (carrot, celery, parsnip)</li>
    <li>Optional sea salt to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  Simmer gently.
  Avoid aggressive spices or strong stimulants.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Important Pacing Notes</h2>

<p>
Kidneys do not respond well to pressure.
If support creates symptoms such as anxiety, weakness, or excessive urination,
that is feedback — not failure.
</p>

<p class="gentle">
Backing off is often the most supportive choice.
</p>

<h2>What This Section Is <em>Not</em></h2>

<ul>
  <li>not a cleanse</li>
  <li>not a diuretic protocol</li>
  <li>not a replacement for medical care</li>
</ul>

<p>
In Guided Foundations, kidney support exists
to improve tolerance and stability —
not to push detox forward.
