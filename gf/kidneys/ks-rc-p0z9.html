<h1>Kidney Support — Recipes & Preparation</h1>

<p class="gentle">
This page exists as a reference only.
Nothing here is required, expected, or necessary for progress.
</p>

<p>
This section is included so that,
if kidney support ever becomes relevant,
it feels familiar and non-threatening —
not so that you feel encouraged to try anything.
</p>

<h2>How to Read This Page</h2>

<p>
Everything below is an <strong>example</strong>, not a recommendation.
These illustrations exist to reduce fear and uncertainty,
not to create action.
</p>

<p class="gentle">
For many people, the healthiest response to this page
is to read it once and never return.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>In Guided Foundations, kidney support is:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>hydrating rather than stimulating</li>
    <li>warming rather than depleting</li>
    <li>supportive rather than corrective</li>
    <li>optional rather than progressive</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<h2>When Gentle Kidney Support Is Relevant</h2>

<p>
This information is relevant only
when signs of kidney strain are already present.
It is not meant for experimentation
or “preventive” use.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ongoing dehydration despite adequate fluid intake</li>
  <li>poor tolerance to detox or cleansing efforts</li>
  <li>electrolyte instability</li>
  <li>fatigue that improves with rest but returns quickly</li>
  <li>a persistent “wired but tired” pattern</li>
</ul>

<p class="gentle">
These patterns describe workload —
not damage, deficiency, or diagnosis.
</p>

<h2>Herbal Kidney Support Tea (Educational Example)</h2>

<p>
Herbal teas are among the gentlest forms of kidney support
when support is appropriate.
They emphasize hydration and soothing
without forcing elimination.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Simple Kidney Support Tea (Reference Only)</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>1–2 teaspoons dried nettle leaf</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon marshmallow root <em>(cold infusion preferred)</em></li>
    <li>Filtered water</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Combine herbs with water.
    Marshmallow root is typically prepared as a cold infusion
    over several hours or overnight.
    Warm gently if desired.
  </p>

  <p class="gentle">
    This tea is intended to soothe and hydrate —
    not to increase urination or stimulate detox.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Warming Kidney-Supportive Broth (Food-Based Example)</h2>

<p>
Warm, mineral-rich foods often support kidney regulation
more reliably than liquids alone.
Broths provide warmth, structure, and gentle nourishment —
all of which support reserve.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>Simple Kidney-Supportive Broth</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Filtered water</li>
    <li>Root vegetables (carrot, celery, parsnip)</li>
    <li>Optional sea salt to taste</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Simmer gently.
    Avoid strong spices or aggressive stimulation.
  </p>
</div>

<h2>Important Pacing Feedback</h2>

<p>
Kidneys respond best to low pressure.
If any form of support leads to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>increased anxiety</li>
  <li>weakness or depletion</li>
  <li>excessive urination</li>
  <li>internal agitation or discomfort</li>
</ul>

<p class="gentle">
That response is communication —
not intolerance.
Backing off is the correct response.
</p>

<h2>What This Section Is <em>Not</em></h2>

<ul>
  <li>not a cleanse</li>
  <li>not a detox protocol</li>
  <li>not a diuretic approach</li>
  <li>not a substitute for medical care</li>
</ul>

<p>
In Guided Foundations, kidney support exists
to protect stability and tolerance —
not to push progress.
</p>

<p class="gentle">
If nothing here feels relevant,
that is a positive sign.
