<h1>Kidney Support — Protocol Reference</h1>

<p class="gentle">
This page is part of the Guided Foundations program.
Nothing on this page is required, expected, or meant to be acted on.
</p>

<p>
This section exists purely as a <strong>reference point</strong>.
Its role is to clarify language and reduce uncertainty —
not to suggest that anything needs to be added, adjusted, or evaluated.
</p>

<h2>Why Protocols Are Mentioned at All</h2>

<p>
Kidney support protocols are included in Foundations
so that the concept of “support” does not feel vague or alarming
if it is mentioned elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
They exist to describe ways internal load is sometimes reduced —
not as recommendations,
and not as steps to complete.
</p>

<p>
In practice, many people never use kidney-focused protocols at all.
This is a complete and valid outcome.
</p>

<p class="gentle">
In Foundations, protocols are descriptors —
not instructions.
</p>

<h2>What Kidney Support Typically Emphasizes</h2>

<div class="callout">
<p><strong>When kidney support is discussed, it usually refers to:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>maintaining hydration with appropriate mineral balance</li>
  <li>allowing overall detox intensity to decrease</li>
  <li>avoiding additional strain on clearance systems</li>
  <li>prioritizing warmth, rest, and nervous system regulation</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Notice that these elements focus on reducing demand,
not increasing output.
</p>

<h2>When “Protocols” Are Not the Right Frame</h2>

<p>
If the body feels overwhelmed,
activated,
or depleted,
the idea of protocols can add unnecessary pressure.
</p>

<p>
In those moments,
the most supportive response is usually to simplify —
not to introduce or evaluate options.
</p>

<p class="gentle">
Stability comes from containment,
not from choosing the “right” approach.
</p>

<h2>How This Page Is Meant to Be Used</h2>

<p>
Most people will read this page once
and never return to it.
</p>

<p>
Its value is in:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>understanding what kidney support language actually means</li>
  <li>reducing fear when symptoms fluctuate</li>
  <li>recognizing when less input is appropriate</li>
  <li>avoiding escalation during sensitive periods</li>
</ul>

<p class="gentle">
Education reduces urgency.
Reduced urgency allows regulation.
</p>

<h2>Returning to Stability</h2>

<p>
If symptoms are present,
the most reliable form of kidney support
is often already in place:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>balanced hydration</li>
  <li>adequate warmth</li>
  <li>rest and reduced stimulation</li>
  <li>time</li>
</ul>

<p>
If stability returns,
there is no reason to revisit this page.
</p>

<p class="gentle">
Foundations does not reward action.
It supports awareness.
