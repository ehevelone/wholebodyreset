<h1>Kidney Support — Readiness Gate</h1>

<p class="gentle">
This page is a checkpoint — not a requirement.
Nothing needs to be started, stopped, or changed because of what you read here.
</p>

<p>
This gate exists to help you recognize
when the body may be asking for **less load, not more effort**.
</p>

<p>
During hydration, cleansing, or periods of increased change,
the kidneys quietly help regulate pace and reserve.
When overall load increases,
the nervous system often signals first.
</p>

<div class="callout">
  <p><strong>You may be near this gate if you notice:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Symptoms feeling louder instead of quieter</li>
    <li>Increased restlessness or difficulty settling</li>
    <li>Hydration feeling harder to tolerate than expected</li>
    <li>A “wired but tired” or depleted feeling</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
These signals do <strong>not</strong> mean harm or damage.
They usually indicate that the system is carrying
more input than it can comfortably integrate right now.
</p>

<p class="gentle">
This is information — not a problem to solve.
</p>

<h2>What This Gate Is — and Is Not</h2>

<div class="callout">
  <ul>
    <li><strong>This gate is:</strong> a point of awareness</li>
    <li><strong>This gate is:</strong> permission to reduce pressure</li>
    <li><strong>This gate is not:</strong> a signal to add support</li>
    <li><strong>This gate is not:</strong> a sign you’ve gone too far</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
If the descriptions above resonate,
kidney support may be useful —
not to increase detox or effort,
but to restore steadiness and tolerance.
</p>

<p class="gentle">
Some people pass through this gate briefly.
Others return to it at different points.
Both are normal.
</p>

<h2>What Often Helps Most Right Now</h2>

<p>
At this stage, the most stabilizing response
is usually <strong>simplification</strong>.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Allowing hydration to remain gentle and unforced</li>
  <li>Letting overall intensity decrease</li>
  <li>Prioritizing warmth, rest, and consistency</li>
</ul>

<p class="gentle">
If symptoms soften as pressure decreases,
that is the body recalibrating —
not something being “fixed.”
</p>

<p>
If curiosity remains,
you may explore the Gentle Integration or Recipes pages
as education only.
There is no requirement to continue.
